    <h2>What do you want to achieve with the visualization?</h2>
    <p>With my visualization, I wanted to visualize the author’s writing style in each short stories in a q quantitative form. To do so, I believed that by quantitatively showing the frequency of words used, I would be able to show which words the author prefers in his/her writing style. Since certain types of words, such as interjection or articles, always appear more than any other words in a text, I decided to group words by eight parts of speech so that variety of words could be shown and visualized. Additionally, I believed that showing frequency of words by grouping them with parts of speech and visualizing them would show the overall theme of the story. Therefore, by listing words by their frequency, I believed that I could not only show author’s writing style but also overall summary of the story.</p>
    <h2>What tasks do you want to support?</h2>
    <p>Tasks that I wanted to support in my visualization were to effectively visualize my statistical and somewhat mundane quantitative data to my viewers in a way that is more interactive and aesthetic. At the same time, I did not want to complicate my visualization so that the viewers would not have to look more than 10 seconds to figure out what each visualization represented. </p>
    <h2>What designs will help you accomplish these? Name at least two.</h2>
    <p>To make my visualization interactive and easier to understand, I decided to use simple yet most practical and intuitive form of data visualization: bar graph. By using bar graph, I believed that I would be able to present my data effectively. Additionally, I considered an option of sorting the data so that the bar graph becomes easy on the eye and visualize trend of words. Another form of visualization that I wanted to use was showing most used word in each group of eight parts of speech. To help viewers easily understand that each word belongs to its group of eight parts of speech, I decided to color-code them. /p>
    <h2>Images of Visualization</h2>

    <h2>A justification for the final design</h2>
    <p>I believe that the visual representation of data that I provided ultimately helps viewers to analyze the author’s writing style and overall summary of the story. By showing the frequency of words by group of eight parts of speech in a bar graph, it helps viewers to find out about the author’s writing style and a clue of what the story is about. With the text visualization, viewers would be able to grasp an overarching theme of the short story. Additionally, I made querying for data more interactive by having the users to select book from a book-shelf like set of buttons and select eight parts of speech tag with a bookmark-like button.</p>
